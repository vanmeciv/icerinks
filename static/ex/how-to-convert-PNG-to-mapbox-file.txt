Directions:

1. Import PNG to ArcGIS Pro (Drag & Drop)
2. Georeference the image and centering it at 0,0
	a. Use Go to XY to find 0,0 and move the Extent
	b. Use Georeference to Fit to Display
	c. Change scale to 1:75,000,000 (so that the extens fits -100/45/100/-45)
	e. Coordinate System WGS_1984
	f. Change Clipping Geometry to As Specified Below
	g. Extents L/T/R/B to -100/45/100/-45
		(or as close to this without going inside these extents)
	h. Save New Georeference
